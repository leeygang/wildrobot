## [v0.3.0] - 2024-12-23: Velocity Normalization

### Problem
Speed mismatch between reference motion data (~0.27 m/s) and commanded velocity (0.5-1.0 m/s). Discriminator penalized policy for walking at correct speed.

### Changes

#### Capability
- **Velocity Direction Normalization**: Root linear velocity normalized to unit direction vector
- **Safe Thresholding**: If speed < 0.1 m/s, use zero vector (handles stationary frames)
- **Feature Validation Script**: `scripts/validate_feature_consistency.py` ensures reference = policy features

#### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `amp/amp_features.py` | Safe velocity normalization with 0.1 m/s threshold |
| `scripts/convert_ref_data_normalized_velocity.py` | Reference data conversion script |
| `scripts/validate_feature_consistency.py` | End-to-end feature validation |
| `reference_data_generation.md` | Updated pipeline documentation |

#### Config
```yaml
amp:
  dataset_path: playground_amp/data/walking_motions_normalized_vel.pkl
  # Feature dim remains 29 (direction replaces raw velocity)
```

#### Feature Format (29-dim)
| Index | Feature | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| 0-8 | Joint positions | |
| 9-17 | Joint velocities | |
| 18-20 | Root velocity **DIRECTION** | Normalized unit vector (NEW) |
| 21-23 | Root angular velocity | |
| 24 | Root height | |
| 25-28 | Foot contacts | |

### Validation
- ✅ 63.4% moving frames (norm = 1.0)
- ✅ 36.6% stationary frames (norm = 0.0)
- ✅ Reference and policy features identical

### Expected Result
- AMP reward should be smoother (no speed penalty)
- Discriminator learns gait style, not speed matching
- Policy can walk at commanded speed without AMP penalty

### Status
🔄 Ready to train - awaiting results

## [v0.2.0] - 2024-12-22: Discriminator Tuning (Middle-Ground)

### Problem
Initial discriminator settings caused disc_acc stuck at 0.97-0.99 (too strong).
Over-correction caused disc_acc collapse to 0.50 (not learning).

### Changes

#### Config Evolution
| Setting | Initial | Over-corrected | Final (Middle-ground) |
|---------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| `disc_lr` | 1e-4 | 2e-5 | **5e-5** |
| `update_steps` | 3 | 1 | **2** |
| `gradient_penalty_weight` | 5.0 | 20.0 | **15.0** |
| `disc_input_noise_std` | 0.0 | 0.05 | **0.05** |

#### Final Config
```yaml
amp:
  weight: 0.3
  disc_lr: 5e-5
  batch_size: 256
  update_steps: 2
  gradient_penalty_weight: 15.0
  disc_input_noise_std: 0.05
```

### Result
- ✅ Healthy disc_acc oscillation: 0.72-0.95
- ✅ AMP reward stable
- ❌ Speed mismatch still present (addressed in v0.3.0)

### Lessons Learned
- `disc_acc = 0.50` means discriminator collapsed (not learning)
- `disc_acc = 0.97+` means discriminator too strong
- Target: `disc_acc = 0.6-0.8` with healthy oscillation
- Don't over-handicap the discriminator

## [v0.1.1] - 2024-12-21: JIT Compilation Fix

### Problem
30-second GPU idle after first training iteration.

### Cause
Second JIT compilation when switching from single iteration to batch mode.

### Fix
Pre-compile both `train_iteration_fn` and `train_batch_fn` before training starts.

#### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `training/trainer_jit.py` | Pre-compile JIT functions with dummy call |
| `train.py` | Added PID display for easy termination |

#### Code
```python
# Pre-compile both functions before training
print("Pre-compiling JIT functions...")
_ = train_iteration_fn(state, env_state, ref_buffer_data)
jax.block_until_ready(_)

if train_batch_fn is not None:
    _ = train_batch_fn(state, env_state, ref_buffer_data)
    jax.block_until_ready(_)
```

### Result
- ✅ No more GPU idle after iteration #1
- ✅ Smooth training from start

## [v0.1.0] - 2024-12-20: Initial AMP Training Pipeline

### Capability
- PPO + AMP adversarial training
- LSGAN discriminator formulation
- Reference motion from AMASS via GMR retargeting
- W&B logging integration
- Checkpoint save/restore

### Config
```yaml
trainer:
  num_envs: 1024
  rollout_steps: 128
  iterations: 1000
  lr: 3e-4

reward_weights:
  tracking_lin_vel: 5.0
  base_height: 0.3
  action_rate: -0.01

amp:
  weight: 0.3
  discriminator_hidden: [256, 128]
```

### Result
- Training functional but disc_acc issues (see v0.2.0)
- Speed mismatch discovered (see v0.3.0)

## Quick Reference

### Discriminator Tuning Guide
| Symptom | disc_acc | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Disc too strong | 0.95+ | ↓ disc_lr, ↓ update_steps, ↑ gradient_penalty |
| Disc collapsed | ~0.50 | ↑ disc_lr, ↑ update_steps, ↓ gradient_penalty |
| Healthy | 0.6-0.8 | Keep current settings |

### Feature Validation
```bash
# Validate reference = policy features
uv run python scripts/validate_feature_consistency.py

# Analyze reference data velocities
uv run python scripts/analyze_reference_velocities.py
```

### Training Commands
```bash
# Start training
cd ~/projects/wildrobot
uv run python playground_amp/train.py

# Kill training (PID printed at startup)
kill -9 <PID>
```
